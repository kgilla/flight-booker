# Fly Away

This website was made as a part of the Ruby on Rails section of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) curriculum. Fly Away is a simple Ruby on Rails web application that was built to work on creating more advanced forms - similar to that found within an actual flight booking website.

## Learning Objectives

- Further my familiarity and competence with Ruby on Rails and ERB.
- Get more comfortable passing data to multiple controllers in sequence via multi-part forms.
- Learn to better utilize the many Rails Helpers to make development easier and less time-consuming/verbose.
- Create a large database with the seed.rb file in Ruby on Rails.
- Change the default [SQLlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database over to [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for both development and production.
- Improve on my understanding and execution of responsive design principles.
